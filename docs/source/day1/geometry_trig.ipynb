This can be as simple as converting a quantity from one unit to another, but gets more complicated when we have multiple quantities, sometimes in uncompatible units, within an expression."

You are likely familiar with a few common ones: \"kilo-\" for thousands (a kilometer is a thousand meters, a kilogram is a thousand grams), \"centi-\" for hundredths (a centimeter is a hundredth of a meter), etc. Below is a shortened version of [this table](https://www.nist.gov/pml/owm/metric-si-prefixes) with the prefixes I've seen in Earth sciences, but the table extends on both sides if you need very small or very large units."

We know there are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24(ish) hours in a day, and 365 (ish) days in a year. Be aware that it gets more complicated when we work with data and need to be more exact in our conversions (not ignoring leap years and such). Programming languages typically have built-in functions to help with working with date/time data, as described [here for Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/date-and-time-operations.html) and [here for Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)\n",

It is easiest if you are given this information with the dataset, but in a worst-case scenario you can do some quick calculations or try a few common epochs in your data analysis to see which produces the correct result."

You may also see density values ranging from 20 to 30 instead, when the density of freshwater (1000) has been subtracted. Density in the ocean is a function of salinity, temperature, and pressure ($\\rho = \\rho (S,T,p)$).\n",
